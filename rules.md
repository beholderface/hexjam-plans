# Rules

1. All submissions must be at least visible-source. They don't have to be under a fully open-source license, but everything required to build your mod from source must be publicly visible.
2. Submissions may not contain AI-generated material of any kind.
3. Submissions must be available in English. If you are not fluent in English, machine translation is acceptable. This is an exception to rule #2.
4. Submissions must be compatible with Hexcasting 0.11.2 on Fabric.
5. Submissions must comply with the rules of the Petrak@'s Mods Discord server. If you wouldn't be able to send a given thing in there without necessitating moderator action, it should not be present in your submission.
6. *NO MALWARE*
