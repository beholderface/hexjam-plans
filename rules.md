# Rules

1. All submissions must be at least visible-source. They don't have to be under a fully open-source license, but everything required to build your mod from source must be publicly visible.
2. Submissions may not contain AI-generated material of any kind.
3. Submissions must be available in English. If you are not fluent in English, machine translation is acceptable. This is an exception to rule #2.
4. One submission per person. You may work in teams, but any given team still only gets one submission.
5. All work on submissions beyond planning stages must take place within the timespan of the jam. Use of some preexisting code is acceptable, as long as the code in question was written for something other than the jam.
6. Submissions must be compatible with Hexcasting 0.11.2.
7. Submissions must comply with the rules of the Petrak@'s Mods Discord server. If you wouldn't be able to send a given thing in there without necessitating moderator action, it should not be present in your submission.
8. *NO MALWARE*
9. If need be, judges may disqualify submissions which do not break these rules (I expect this to only be used if someone is generally interacting in bad faith, but idk). If one deems this necessary, a majority of judges must vote in favor of disqualification.
